## Photoshop Battle

In this assignment, you are going to implement some basic operations to simulate Photoshop techniques and try to give the best results among your colleagues. You are going to use images that are given from MSRA10K [1] dataset which have foreground object masks as well. First, you will separate the foreground object by using the given mask and then put it on a different image to change the background of the foreground object. You will set the position of the foreground object by changing the location of the pixels in order to put it on a meaningful place. You may crop the foreground object/image and its mask accordingly. After that, you will add some depth to your image by blurring the background and sharpening the foreground.
